A schema defines the structure of the content.

Each field has multiple states:

1. **Hidden**: The field will not be returned by the api and only visible in the management portal.

2. **Disabled**: The field cannot be manipulated in the management portal. Do not use it together with the required operator.

You have to publish your schema before you can create content.
