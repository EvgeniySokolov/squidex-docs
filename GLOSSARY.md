## Event
An event is an action that has been completed in the past.

## Event Sourcing
Event sourcing is an approach to thinking about persistent data where the primary record is a log of all events that make updates. A traditional representation of database state can be entirely recreated by reprocessing this event log. Event sourcing's benefits include strong auditing, creation of historic state, and replaying of events for debugging and analysis. Event sourcing has been around for a while, but we think it is used much less than it should be.
